Architecture:

Try some experiment for the MongoDB + implement the model of the DB
Handling accounts (login, logout, email)
Use Next.js, new framework - which has the static site generation
Next.js must have a specific file architecture (component, api, pages, etc folder)
Process DOM
Postman

Middlewares
mongod --dbpath ~/Desktop/HyperTube/api/data

Do Not Fetch an API Route from getStaticProps or getStaticPaths. You should not fetch an API Route from getStaticProps or getStaticPaths. Instead, write your server-side code directly in getStaticProps or getStaticPaths (or call a helper function).

- getStaticProps (Static Generation): Fetch data at build time.

- getStaticPaths (Static Generation): Specify dynamic routes to pre-render based on data.
